## 3. Categories of data subjects

- **Merchants** (shop owner / operator): business contact (email, shop domain).
- **Shoppers** (end consumers): **NOT a data subject for this app.** We do not store shopper identifiers. Search query strings are retained at the aggregate-query level, not linked to any shopper.

## 8. Technical and organisational measures

- AES-256-GCM encryption of access tokens at rest.

- Session-token-bound access for all merchant endpoints; admin console behind email allowlist + proxy-layer auth.
- HMAC verification on all webhooks.
- PII scrubbed from Sentry payloads before egress.
- Least-privilege DB role for app (no DDL).
- Nightly encrypted backups; tested restore quarterly (see `RUNBOOK.md`).

## 9. Incident response

## 10. Review schedule

Quarterly review. Material changes require a new DPIA (Data Protection
Impact Assessment) — template in `docs/DPIA_TEMPLATE.md` (to be created
when the first material change lands).
