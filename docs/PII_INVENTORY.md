## Subject rights workflow

- **Access/export**: in-app Settings → Privacy → Export my data (`POST /api/privacy/export`).
- **Deletion**: merchant uninstalls the app; hard delete fires 30d later OR immediately on Shopify `shop/redact`. Reinstall within 48h cancels deletion.
- **Rectification**: shop domain, email are sourced from Shopify — fix in Shopify and re-sync.
- **Objection**: unsubscribe link in every digest (`/unsubscribe?token=...`).
